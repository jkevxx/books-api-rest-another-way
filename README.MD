## Passing app as a Parameter OR Using app.use('/api', routes)

Both approaches have their merits, and the choice between passing the app instance as a parameter or using app.use('/api', routes) depends on your application's structure and your personal preference.

### Passing app as a Parameter:

> Pros:
>
> - Explicit Dependency: Passing app as a parameter makes it clear that your router module depends on the app instance.
> - Easier Testing: It can make testing easier because you can easily mock the app instance when testing your router module.

> Cons:
>
> - Slightly More Verbose: This approach can make your code a bit more verbose, especially if you have multiple routers.

Example:

```javascript
// routerApi.js
const express = require('express');
const booksRouter = require('./books.router');

function routerApi(app) {
  const router = express.Router();
  app.use('/api/v1', router);
  router.use('/books', booksRouter);
}

module.exports = routerApi;
```

### Using app.use('/api', routes):

> Pros:
>
> - Conciseness: This approach is more concise and may be considered more straightforward.
> - Less Boilerplate: It reduces the need for explicit parameter passing in your router modules.

> Cons:
>
> - Implicit Dependency: It introduces a level of implicit dependency on the app instance, which might make it less clear at first glance where the app instance is coming from.

Example:

```javascript
// main.js
const express = require('express');
const routerApi = require('./routerApi');
const booksRouter = require('./books.router');

const app = express();
routerApi(app);
app.use('/api/v1/books', booksRouter);

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

#### Recommendation:

- If your application is small or you prefer a more concise style, using app.use('/api', routes) directly in your main file might be simpler.
- If your application is larger and you want to explicitly manage dependencies and facilitate testing, passing app as a parameter to router modules might be a better choice.

Ultimately, the "better" approach depends on the specific requirements and preferences of your project and team.
